(Warning: NSFW language to follow).

Hello, world. I'm starting a blog. This one's for me. Nobody will probably ever read it. I just wanted to start a journal, but I'm kind of losing my ability to write by hand for more than a few sentences. So, fuck it, why not post it online for no one to see. 

Here's the truth: I have MS. 

Now that that's out of the way, here's the second truth: frankly, I don't give a damn. 

Seriously. Whatever. 

I didn't always feel this way. It took a long time to get to an MS diagnosis, because I have other major auto-immune issues, and the VA rated me a service-connected disabled veteran, citing my service as a combat medic in Ramadi, Iraq during "The Surge" as the cause. Because certain symptoms of my MS mimicked symptoms of other health issues I was believed to have, it was overlooked and ignored. It took five years from the onset of my first MS symptoms before finally receiving a Brain and Spinal MRI and discovering lesions. Finally they began other tests to verify MS, and what do you know? The MRI and years of tell-tale signs and symptoms didn't lie. I digress. 

Thing is, I can't do anything about it. It took my a long time to come to that realization. Nothing I do will change the fact I have MS (and other things... seriously, I'm pretty messed up). After fighting my illness for years, I finally stopped feeling sorry for myself. Then I went back to college.

Yes, I'm a disabled adult back in college. 

But why, tho? 

Here's the deal. I grew up poor. Like, po', so po' we couldn't afford the R. Po'! After high school I tried college, couldn't afford it and got kicked out, and then I dabbled in homelessness for a few months before joining the army. Basically right after basica training and medic training I got called to Iraq, got married on my way like a stereotypical war story, then headed to war. I came back home over a year later seemingly fine, in one piece, but with some weird health concerns that started rearing their ugly little fucking heads – they weren't anything to worry about back then, but oh did they progress... assholes. Anyway, I returned home from Iraq to a my bride, and we fought like hell to survive in a bad economy. I even co-founded a little online news startup that made it through funding and past the two year mark during that economy. I used that experience to get into corporate management, and despite being among the youngest in my role in a large industry-leading company, I maintained some of the best numbers in the business (even though I was young, innexperienced, and unneducated). So, I guess what I'm trying to say is: I'm a warrior. I'm a fighter. I don't accept limitations, and I don't back down. To me, nothing is impossible, but merely a challenge.

Well, that was how I felt until I found myself in the ER over and over again. My health snowballed, and one day that giant snowball rolled off a cliff, landed in some thick ass snow and caused a fuckinging avalanche! One day I just suddenly felt my body dying. Like, no joke, I was pretty sure I wouldn't live to see tomorrow, dying. And this went on and on and on and on for days and days, and weeks, and months, then years...

Slowly with the help of many, many doctors and lots of medical debts I discovered the root of some of my problems, and I had to seriously adjust my lifestyle to see anything like improvements. If you're someone who knows me in person, when you see me you may think I'm fine. What you don't see is everything that goes on behind closed doors to maintain that appearance. I stay home all the time. I do. ALL. THE. TIME. If you see me out and about, it's probably the first time I left the house in a week. I avoid public, because public is full of things that want to kill me. I have to control my environment if I want to survive. Temperature and air quality are major concerns for me. If it's too hot or too cold, I'm fuckedd. And if there's a bunch of food fumes, then I'm really fucked. And let's be clear, a bunch of food fumes to me is probably unnoticeable food fumes for the normal person. "But what food fumes?" you might ask. All of them. All the fumes. I'm allergic to all the food. Of the few ingredients I can consume, I cook all my own meals at home and maintain a very specific, bland, expensive, and extremely time-consuming organic diet with way too much repitition. I clean every single day. Like, vaccuum the floors and change the bedding, and sweep and mop and do a whole damn deep clean or I might die tonight. I keep a suction device by my bed for those nights when that's just not enough. I have rescue medications stationed throughout the house for those "oh, shit" times. I have to plan my meals and travel and sleep, and basically every single little choice I make has to be extremely strategic or I might die. It sounds dramatic, but it's actually just my everyday routine. 

Oh, also, did I mention I'm heat sensitive? I live in Florida because sunshine = vitamin D. But also sunshine = heat, and my body's ability to respond to heat and temperature changes has drastically worsened since I settled here. When I get hot, my immune system literally attacks my brain. I lose energy, I get confused, I get dizzy, I get blurry vision, I can't stand, I can't walk, I fall down stairs, etc, etc. Seriously, when I get hot – to quote white girls everywhere – I just can't even. I'm, like, so totally fucked. 

Did I mention I live in Florida? Southwest florida. Right on the fucking surface of the sun.

Maybe not the best choice for someone with my health concerns, but seriously, there really isn't a good choice anywhere. 

On top of that, I'm prone to pushing myself too hard and it has monumental consequences. Seriously, if I endure too much stress my chronic fatigue turns into acute "I-can't-lift-my-fucking-arms-or-walk-right." If it get's too exhausting, my body's default is to turn a pale blue-green shade of white and pass the fuck out. Then my MS gives me shit about it for days, even weeks, before I really gain "full" mobility back. Every time that happens it's a big question of "will I regain it all back this time?" 

Seriously guys, I'm fucked. You don't want this life. 

Whatever. 

But seriously, whatever. I'm listing this all for context, but do you really care? No. Right? Of course you don't. You're not even reading this. And I don't even care, really, either. Fuck it.  

Maybe it's a defense mechanism, but finally one day I just woke up and didn't give a fuck anymore.

I no longer cared about my limitations. I no longer cared about the routine – I'm used to it, it's just routine. I'm used to being closed off, isolated, alone, misunderstood, thought to be lazy, blah, blah, blah, fucking blah. I'm over it all. 

No, not in the "I'm going to off myself" kinda way. I'm way beyond that. That's what people do when they do give a shit, and I just don't. 

I don't.

Honeybadger don't give a shit. 

I'm a selfish asshole now. I used to care about others, try to put myself out there for others, but now I've found balance by learning the word "NO." When people want something from me, I don't give a shit, so, "No." When people want to hang out with me (and trust me, they don't), I don't give a shit, so I say "No!" I've gotten good at it. No is my favorite new word. 

But why no? Because I don't give a shit. No, because I don't want to go on your deep sea fishing trip (I mean, I kinda do, but not enough to suffer the consequences - I mean, in this heat, I might not make it back from that one). No, because I don't want to be your free developer in a trade for shares in a startup idea you have that is just never gonna get off the ground, and frankly I don't give a shit. No to whatever it is you're about to ask, before you even get the words out of your mouth, because I just don't care. 

It's as simple as that. I'm selfish. I don't care.

I'm focused on me, on living one day at a time, on taking one step at a time, on surviving, on finding my own little piece of happiness, and frankly: it's working. I'm happy. I'm like a living dead man, and I'm happy.

How did I come to this level of acceptance? I found stoicism. Seriously. Stoicism changed my outlook. My outlook used to consist of looking at at life through Facebook and wishing I had what you have, that I could be normal, that I could live the normal, boring, rat-race lifestyle. But I can't. I really can't. And stoicism helped me realize that, and accept that, and give me a new outlook. Whatever happens is gonna happen, and I can't change that, and I can't have an affect on anything but me, and my actions and reactions. I can't choose not to have MS (and other arguably worse things), but I can choose how I choose to react to it. 

On that subject, I'm starting this blog. I don't expect anyone's going to read it, so I'm not even editing it. I won't change the grammer, punctiation, spelling, none of it. I don't give a shit, and no one's reading this. Besides, I don't use words good. English is my first and only language, and I suck at it. In the army profanities became commonplace in my word regimen, and so since that's how I think and speak in my own little island at home, that's the fucking way its pouring out on this screen, because: fuck you, this is my blog. I'll fucking say fuck as much as I fucking want. Why should I give a fuck? And why should you? 

Seriosuly, I don't give a fuck. 

Now, there are exceptions. 

Warren Buffett. 

No, I don't really give a fuck about him either, but I respect *some* of his choices - mostly I just respect his ability to command his environment to create the life he did. Atta boy, Warren, you old dog.

Warren Buffett gave a piece of advice to a pilot named Mike Flint. Flint had been a pilot, happily flying the old bastard around for pay, and Warren thought that clearly Mike wasn't succeeding in life because he's only a pilot, or something like that. Look, it all sounds a bit arrogent, but who am I judge? Anyway, what worked for Warren must work, so here's what he said to Flint: "5/25 rule. List 25 goals. Circle your top 5. Tell the other 20 to fuck off (I'm paraphrasing here). And that's it. The whole recipe. 5 parts give a fuck, 20 parts don't give a fuck, renders one damn succesful life. 

So... that's what I'm gonna do. 

I mean, what have I got to lose, right? Could my life be any harder? Doubt it. I can't change the fact it's hard, so why not fight like hell to achieve something. 

So here's my 5: 

1. Get healthy (look, it's all relative, I'm not gonna be a damn olympic athlete, I have fucking MS and shit). 
	A. Keep up the diet, but work in more pretein (I went vegan, BTW. It helps with the MS. It's totally a thing, and it's working wonders for me). 
    B. Pick up heavy shit and put it back down. ("WHAT?! LIFT WEIGHTS WITH WITH MS AND SHIT?!" you might scream. Fuck you, make your own life choices. This one's for me. Why? Cardio is a killer for me. Serously, cardio and HIIT are off the table. I can't progress if I'm passing out and then having month-long MS relapses every time I work out. So HIIT and cardio are out. So is the ol' body building life of lifting six days a week and training so you can pose in little bikinis and show the world how in love with yourself you are. Eww. No thanks. I just wanna be healthy-ish (it's all relative (yes, parenthesis within parenthesis. deal with it. (it's totally a developer thing. (did I mention I'm a developer?)))so mind your own fucking business).
    This one's totally number one, because I have MS and shit, and because I need to gain as much strength and health as I can if I'm gonna live long enough to be of some value to those I care about. 
    
2. Stop cussing. (just fucking kidding. lol).

2. Be better a husband / father (seroiusly, my honeybadger-don't-care attitude cannot rear its head at everything my wife has to say. That would make me a total asshole. I mean, I am an asshole, but I don't want to be an asshole to my wife. She's a sweet and tender little loving lady with a heart of gold. She doesn't deserve that shit. You do, but not her. She's precious.
Alsp, I don't have kids yet, so making them is an important first step in being a better father). 

3. Get my Ph D. (no, not for a notch on my belt - I genuinely want to have a career, and I like teaching, and I like speaking, and I like research and academia, and screw you if you have a problem with that. I have MS and shit, not the plague. You can't get what I've got. Your kids will be safe. I'll watch my damned language around them, I fucking promise).

4. Grow and expand my consultancy (yes. I consult. Software, tech, etc. This isn't a business proposal or I would've edited out all the fucks, so I'm not going into my business here.)

5. Earn a tenured professor role (pretty self explanatory. But I have to earn my PhD first, and if you're keeping track, I'm still just finally finishing my undergrad as a washed up adult, so goal has time requirements. Bonus, I'm a disabled vet, so I think I get some kind of hiring preference at schools or something. If you've got it, flaunt it. 


That's it. That's my five. That's the whole point of this blog / public journal entry. That's pretty much it. 

Look, I'm not Ernest fucking Hemingway, I'm not a writer. I don't know the rules. This is how I'm ending this shit. Deal with it. Now fuck off.
